# Meme-DB
The structure of the MongoDB-powered database behind MemeDB

> **Note:** The contents of the database will not be disclosed.

## Usage
In a MariaDB server, put your MongoDB uri in `.env.local`, then run `restore.sh`.

You can then copy this `.env.local` file into the codebase for MemeDB and you should have a working (empty) MemeDB instance.
